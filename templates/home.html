      <p><strong>Shiatsu is a specialised form</strong>
        of Japanese Massage. Literally translated, Shiatsu means
        'Finger Pressure'. Shiatsu is more than
        'just' a massage however. Shiatsu has
          its basis in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It utilises the same
          pressure points or <strong>'Tsubos'</strong> as Acupuncture, and incorporates Zen theory
          along with contemporary psychological/physiological
        understanding.</p>
        
    
      <p>This unique viewpoint is one of the real strengths of Shiatsu as a healing practice. Shiatsu is a holistic
          and integrated style of healing encompassing the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual
          levels of human experience. As a holistic treatment I look to treat the whole person and not just the
          &quot;symptoms&quot;.</p>
      <p>Shiatsu works on a basic level by contacting energetic channels
        that run through the body called Meridians. These Meridians (which connect
        the tsubos) can become blocked or stagnant and Shiatsu works to return balance to these channels using gentle pressure
        applied mainly with the palm and fingers.<br />

        <h3>How Shiatsu can help</h3>
        <p>Shiatsu can help restore you and enhance your feeling of well being, it can be practised either therapeutically or just as a great way to relax and unwind.</p>
        <p><strong>What can you treat with Shiatsu</strong></p>
        <p>Many different issues can be resolved through Shiatsu. It is in no way limited to physical issues either, shiatsu is very effective dealing with all areas of a person, so emotional and mental problems are very treatable too. Some of the issues I have found great success dealing with include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stress</li>
          <li>Insomnia</li>
          <li>Anxiety</li>

<h2>News</h2>
<p><strong>Price Increases</strong>
  
  I'm increasing the standard cost of an hour-long session to £55. I'm not changing my concessionary rate or Shiatsu student rate which remain at £35 as I dislike cost being a barrier to entry.</p>      
  <h3>Working From Home and Offering Visits</h3>
  <p>Currently, I'm offering sessions from my home in BS5 area and offering Home Visits within a reasonable radius. I'm continuing to not charge extra for visits.</p>
  
  <h3>Gift Vouchers Available</h3>
  <p>What do you get the person that has everything? Shiatsu gift vouchers that's what! I can post you a voucher for no additional charge so there's something to put in a card etc. Contact me with any queries.</p>          
  <h3>£10 off a Session? Try my Referral Scheme</h3>
  <p>After any session with me you can request (or I'll just give you) some referral cards. You can then give these to anyone you feel would like a go. When they hand the voucher in after their 1st treatment I'll take £10 off for them and for your next visit too! They will however only apply to full price sessions. This is a great way to introduce new people to the benefits of Shiatsu and keep the price down for yourself!</p>
