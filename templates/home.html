      <p><strong>Shiatsu is a specialised form</strong>
        of Japanese Massage. Literally translated, Shiatsu means
        'Finger Pressure'. Shiatsu is more than
        'just' a massage however. Shiatsu has
          its basis in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It utilises the same
          pressure points or <strong>'Tsubos'</strong> as Acupuncture, and incorporates Zen theory
          along with contemporary psychological/physiological
        understanding.</p>
        
    
      <p>This unique viewpoint is one of the real strengths of Shiatsu as a healing practice. Shiatsu is a holistic
          and integrated style of healing encompassing the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual
          levels of human experience. As a holistic treatment I look to treat the whole person and not just the
          &quot;symptoms&quot;.</p>
      <p>Shiatsu works on a basic level by contacting energetic channels
        that run through the body called Meridians. These Meridians (which connect
        the tsubos) can become blocked or stagnant and Shiatsu works to return balance to these channels using gentle pressure
        applied mainly with the palm and fingers.<br />

It is in no way limited to physical issues either, shiatsu is very effective dealing with all areas of a person, so emotional and mental problems are very treatable too.
